Eddie Murphy Christmas Movie,5.0,"Candy Cane Lane is on the less offensive side of Christmas movie releases but suffers from being far too long at an energy draining two hours. Just when it starts wrapping up another 30 minutes come from nowhere.Eddie Murphy carries the movie and helps to push it over the line. It is a step up from his previous Amazon Original, Coming 2 America. Jillian Bell is annoying as always but fits in better in this zany christmas movie.It may not be everyone's cup of tea but Candy Cane Lane passes the time and is at least better than the 50 Hallmark exclusive movies which are soon coming down the pike.",positive
"Dash of Cheer, a Pinch of Symbolism, and a Sprinkle of Cringe",5.0,"Candy Cane Lane delivers a festive punch with its spirited competition for the title of the best-decorated house, adding a touch of homey charm to the holiday tale. The unexpected twist involving a mischievous elf banishment brings a hint of symbolism, though I might be delving too deep into it. Nevertheless, the Christmas magic is palpable, complete with 'Parents Just Don't Understand' vibes, vibrant colors, and whimsical decor.While the humor occasionally falls short in delivery, with jokes teetering on the edge of laughter, the movie brings forth chuckles and witty lines like ""You elf'in kidding me."" Admittedly, it felt like a subtle ad campaign for Jeep, El Segundo's Candy Cane Lane, and USC-Fight on, I suppose. Despite the cheesy and slightly cringy Christmas love, it's a worthwhile watch during the holiday season. I'd give it a festive 2.5/5 stars - because, after all, 'tis the season for a bit of Christmas movie magic!",positive
What a mess...,3.0,"Wow... So Eddie Murphy delivers his second Amazon Movie and his first Christmas themed movie and as a huge Fan of his I can say I'm absolutely disappointed.The movie starts of promising and seems to build up to original ideas, but only goes downhill as soon as the story starts to evolve. Sadly it's a absolute mess and they tried to cram so much into the movie that it's hard to keep track sometimes. The movie lacks depth and characters fight just to reconcile 1 minute later. The movie jumps from scene to scene and every moment of depth conflict or drama is resolved within a max of 3 minutes. There's not one scene that really made me laugh and the movie is so exhausting at times that i really struggled not to turn it off. I don't know what Eddie was thinking but this feels soulless and you can see it on the actors faces and their energy. Everyone seems bored, the dialogue's are hideous and nothing clicks... this is really disappointing and falls in the category of the Eddie Murphy movies that will be forgotten sooner than later.",negative
Delightful!,8.0,"Why the low ratings? This is such a fun family holiday movie. Don't sleep on the adorable end credit scene. This was such an original movie-not like the cookie cutter predictable ones we are all used to. Eddie Murphy is a delight and tracee Ellis Ross is wonderful. I thought it was entertaining and enjoyable. If you want a comedic, colorful Christmas movie, you'll enjoy this. I also enjoyed the representation and inclusion aspect of the movie as well. All around, really lovely family movie. Definitely worth the watch. Much better than family switch on Netflix-woof! Happy holidays, everyone! And a happy new year.",positive
Bit of a guilty pleasure yet so worth it!,8.0,"I'm surprised to see the 5.3 rating especially on the day 1 release, this movie is magnificent! I love most anything with Eddie Murphy some isn't as good but most projects are great. Candy Cane Lane is a unique wonderful holiday film a nice way to prepare for the spirit of everything even if its cheesy I love it quite a bit although I should say I have autism I enjoy different things than most. Very much reminds me of a Matthew Broderick and Danny Devito film called Deck the Halls that's a fun one that's very similar one without as much special effects. I admire Eddie he's done a lot of offbeat ones and iconic projects, I'm sure he's great to be around.",positive
A Fun PG Eddie Murphy Film!,7.0,"We might like to see Eddie Murphy do adult comedy, but this was surprisingly funny and very entertaining. The humor is a mix of adult and young adult and it's actually pretty nice to see Eddie Murphy do something than R rated comedy. Tracee Ellis Ross also compliments his character very well, she hits with the humor right on time and is used very well and not just a (background) wife. The figurines are hilarious as well! Whenever they hit the screen, I at least smiled and chuckled, the CGI was perfect too! Loved every bit of the premise as well. Could Jillian Bell do better as a villian? Yes. Could they have gotten a better actress for that? Maybe. She doesn't take away from the movie but ties it up in the end for what it was. Enjoy this holiday special, i did and you will!",positive
Fun Family Christmas Film from Eddie Murphy,8.0,"""Candy Cane Lane"" is a Christmas-themed comedy starring Eddie Murphy and Tracee Ellis Ross. The movie is directed by Reginald Hudlin (""Boomerang"", ""House Party"", ""The Black Godfather""). Murphy and Ross play a married couple, the Carvers, whose house in the Los Angeles suburbs is a perennial candidate for their block's Christmas decorations contest. Chris (Murphy) in particular is a Christmas obsessionist, so much so that his children (and, coincidentally, his wife) all have Christmas-themed names and the family's garage is overflowing with Christmas memorabilia throughout the year. As the story begins, Chris is a sales manager freshly laid off just in time for the holiday (an exchange with a supervisor references Chris' alleged oldness by the fact that he uses a rolodex). Wife Carol is looking at a promotion at a distribution services factory. In the midst of the very mixed career news for mom and dad, Chris buys a gaudy, flamboyant lawn-decoration Christmas tree a from a pop-up store run by a chatty manager (an alternately perky and menacing Jillian Bell). Unbeknownst to Chris, Pepper the manager is actually a rogue elf (fired by Santa for being a martinet about the naughty list) who likes to sell enchanted Christmas decorations to unsuspecting desperate people, which enacts a curse: if the hapless victim cannot collect enough golden rings by a deadline, they will turn into a living glass miniature, forever! Like, bummer!Needless to say, plenty of Christmas shenanigans ensue, all based around The Twelve Days of Christmas song. So, can Chris, Carol, Joy, Nick and Holly round up all the rings, dodge the Christmas dangers, and live to save the holiday (and maybe win the neighborhood decorations contest)?You'll have to watch to find out! Some other supporting players include some sketch comedy alumni (Chris Redd, Robin Thede, David Alan Grier, Nick Offerman) who get to offer an assortment of quips and jabs during the proceedings.""Candy Cane Lane"" is a perfectly acceptable family-friendly Christmastime film. Murphy and Ross do well as the leads, with a nice rapport between them. Murphy seems to generally rein in his improv instincts and generally sticks to the script by Kelly Younger. In fact, any number of instances where a character is about to curse there's an interjection involving a holiday song, which seems to be a deliberate in-joke about the characters Murphy was known for playing early in his career. Ross, by now a longtime television comedic actress, does well in what could have been a thankless and colorless role. There's plenty of good soundtrack music choices, and the special effects are excellent. Several sequences will find younger kids really entertained.Check it out, and have fun!",positive
Wanted to give it a higher rating...,3.0,"I have been a long time fan of Eddie Murphy and although I haven't always found him as funny as I hoped, his roles have always been charming enough to satiate my expectations.I started this movie with bridled expectations. The camera work and lighting in this movie is really nice, the effects were also quite well done, and I enjoyed some of the music, though I did notice that some of the music sounded like generic loops from Garage Band were used.Where this movie fell apart was the story and delivery. The story felt forced, where it needed more fleshing out and new characters seemed to drop from the sky and clash with the story instead of interweaving.The characters were also annoying, with some just being outright vulgar and some screaming their lines as if screaming somehow validated their dialogue.Eddie Murphy and his family seemed disconnected from each other, as if there had been a miscast of the actors. Their dialogue was shallow and the most disappointing thing was that it wasn't delivered with convincing tone and body language.The movie had all the trappings of all of the common commercialized Christmas movies that are being released now days, case in point there were two prominent cans of brand-name paint on display in one of the first scenes of the movie.This will not be a movie that I add to my yearly watch list by no means.",positive
"Horribly Acted, Horribly Written",1.0,"This was a complete waste of time. I can't believe Eddie Murphy took this gig. Didn't he read the script first? Bad jokes and over-acting by a third rate supporting cast, and Murphy honestly seemed to not care. Either that, or there was only so much he could do with his pathetic lines. He seemed to be phoning it in. I really like him, and hope he gets something better to work with.Special effects were awkward. Lines ended nowhere with a thud. Also, a very objectionable anti-Christian joke.I was wondering whether this movie was written by a relative or something. There had to be some reason to put this poor excuse for entertainment on Prime.",positive
Not a classic,3.0,Small kids might like this between 3 and 7. Other than that very cheesy. Murphy must have needed the money. Overall story line is just corny and stupid. The miniature talking figurines are just silly and not very well done. The cast is a decent combination. All relatively good actors it's just too bad their talents weren't displayed in a decent imagined plot. The elf is depicted by almost a devil themed character and a sacrilegious remark was openly said. Story jumps all over the place between the plot and a normal family. One of those movies made for Prime that failed miserably. Just not a Christmas movie that gives a fuzzy feeling. Just one that makes you realize I just wasted 2 hours.,negative
This is NOT Christams movie you are looking for,2.0,"The trailer was somehwat cute, and fun. I have liked Eddie Murphy in many projects over the years, including Coming 2 America. (after watiching it again, I saw some more fun elements). This project is a disappointment. I really tried to make it through, but had to fast forward to the dismal, predictable ending. Hey, I know that holiday movies have happy conclusions, so that was not the main challenge. The main challeges included- poor script, miscast actors, terrible cgi and Eddie Murphy himself. I like Traci Ellen Ross, however, she is wasted here. Maybe she should have been the lead istead. No, it is simply a poor project idea, with poor execution, start to finish. Skip it.",negative
Scroll on by - waste of time,2.0,"Eddie Murphy wanted to make a film that would be a timeless classic which he felt that family's would watch every Christmas. Well, he did that with Beverly Hills Cop. Not this horrid waste of time.Lots of racist jokes. ..... In a Christmas movie
Some Religious insults to both Christians and Jews.Yep - I'm not kidding. And not off-the-cuff references, but actual flat out ridicule. How does a Christmas movie make fun of Jesus??Two stars because I liked the idea, but then after 5 minutes it tanked.... Fast. Otherwise I would have gone with one star.My advice is pretty straight forward - Avoid this crap.",positive
What a sad waste of Eddie Murphy's great talents . . .,,"Oh dear, oh dear. Largely a perfect example of how NOT to make a Christmas movie!Effectively a diatribe on the wonder & magic of the Christmas spirit. No fun, no levity, and little delight to make it worthwhile viewing in any way.Fortunately a few elements make it as least likeable in parts. There are a few excellent one-liner jokes - so funny they actually made me laugh out loud. I like to think these particular scriptlines may be the result of the Saturday Night Live influence on the movie. So, kudos to the writing team for these winning quips. But other than that, the movie is a waste of 2 hours of the viewer's life.Such a pity. There are some past Christmas movies that really hit the mark, made by a variety of film stars over the decades. These all have their place in Hollywood history. So, for the great Eddie Murphy to bother to make one of his own, after decades of being in Hollywood, this film really should have been well put together. But it wasn't. If it had been edited and fine-tuned till it worked, the movie might have - well - worked!So, shame to see this opportunity so badly wasted.The premise is hardly new to film. Here in the UK a similar plot of neighbours competing over Christmas lights - and the moral of overdoing the in-fighting - was done to perfection by Robson Green & Mark Benton back in the Noughties. That was 'Christmas Lights' (2004). And numerous other offerings have done the same tale well enough in other countries and other decades.This film just ruins the plot concept. Everything in the movie is overdone: it's frenetic, unevenly paced, out of control, and predictably (and badly) scripted. Like many poorly made films it is either edited to too brief a runtime, or as in this case rambles on endlessly. The children are the usual stereotypes, ditto the wife, and the same with the neighbours. Not to mention Murphy's character as the dad & husband. There is no originality in the film where it is needed, and too much invention - to a chaotic level - just where it isn't required. And the longer the film goes on, the more convoluted it gets.There are parts that shouldn't have been put in, eg an anti-Christian 'joke' that goes widely off-mark. The barbed remark is frankly offensive to Christmas itself . . . The film is, after all, supposed to be a Christmas movie, and although Christmas covers far more than one thing for many people - family celebrations, the season before the warmth of spring, partying & togetherness, the end of the calendar year, pagan festivities of old, and a variety of other purposes - it also of course covers Christianity. I consider that 'joke' insulting to the very purpose of Christmas: both the Christ-related part and the more encompassing general spirit of kindness. It is gross . . . And unfunny.The film doesn't appear to have any clear purpose: it doesn't know what it wants to say, or how to say it. And there is too much of everything. Although the animation characters of the '12 Days' is new and clever, it seems not to fit in with the rest of the film. (Though in fact the rest of the film doesn't seem to fit into the rest of the film . . . !) The set of live-miniatures of Christmas Village characters - more animation - are amusing, but again do not seem to segue into the rest of the story. And one set of animation characters in this film would have sufficed.Then there is more confusion added to the mix: competing presenters of seasonal TV, teen troubles, an evil elf, current bosses to impress, 10 lords a-leaping turning up at school sports day, and yet more . . . All this needs to be digested by the viewer. Not to mention the task the family have to complete, of finding the gold rings before the clock chimes on Christmas Eve . . . Then 'Santa Claus' suddenly turns up, swooping in on a sleigh! Oh dear. Just because you CAN say or do something in a film, doesn't mean you should. Less is normally a case of more . . .There are a few excellent moments: when Murphy's character is appalled to see Valentine's Day goods on sale at the market at the same time as Christmas goodies. And a lovely disagreement amongst the Dickensian 'figurines' about the old argument as to whether 'Die Hard' is a Christmas movie. Lovely!But there are not enough laughs throughout the movie . . . And not enough cohesion in the storyline to even work out what this film is all about. Clarity is all-important in most film plots, but we don't see it here. Halfway through the film I still couldn't work out what exactly I was watching . . . (Harrumph!)No, for a good Christmas movie I shall continue to watch from the roster of great Hollywood & UK seasonal films. One of my favourite Christmas movies simply has to be Frank Capra's 'It's a Wonderful Life'. It covers the 'ups' & 'downs' parts of Christmas to perfection, and is as relevant today as it was decades ago.And for a good Murphy movie, I will delve back into his past greatness. There is plenty there to choose from. Need I mention, for example, the superlative 'Trading Places' . . .",positive
Don't waste your time,1.0,"If you like Eddie Murphy, don't waste your and his time. You won't see the real Eddie Murphy. Not because of him but because of the horrible script and direction of this wasteful and boring movie. Other actors and actresses are also big part of the camera (they were not supposed to steal at the camera for 65 times). So, watch any other good Christmas movie but didn't waste your time watching this. They picked the wrong kids, also. Eddie Murthy's wife was not so happy acting. Most boring Christmas movie ever. From 1 to 10, I would have given 0 , but the minimum is 1. So, this is a one star. ---",negative
Refreshing and New Story for the Christmas Season,9.0,"Every year we see the same Christmas movies that have done well in the past. They are vaunted each year with advertisements, and some even run 24/7 around the holidays (Christmas Story anyone?). But after a while, they get stale. I mean, how many times am I going to watch Elf before the magic disappears forever? And there are some movies I simply don't watch anymore, because of this. So it was a pleasant surprise to find Candy Cane Lane: it is fresh, new, funny, and heart-warming. Eddie Murphy was awesome of course, as were the other stars, and I look forward to seeing this one again next year. I can imagine that Candy Cane Lane will likely fall into the ""watch every year"" type that Miracle on 34th Street, Elf, Christmas With the Kranks, etc., etc. Are placed. But at least for now, this movie is different and new. I hope more stories like these continue to come out.",positive
Candy Cane Lane Is At Times Lame . . . .,6.0,"I'm surprised some reviewers thought this movie was vulgar. I thought it was the first movie I've seen in a long time, directed towards children, that did not have crude remarks and events. (Adam Sandler obviously had nothing to do with making it.) Yes, it does have some obscene words and a few inuendos, but nothing like most movies these days.The movie's main strength lies in the relationships between the very likable family members. Two of the three kids are teenagers wanting to do their own thing, while the parents, especially Dad, think they know what's best for them. Thankfully, there are no gender issues or other politically correct stuff stuffed into this film. A pleasant surprise for an Amazon movie!The kids are normal, the parents are normal, family life is normal, until it is not. There's lots of amusing lines and events in the film, but the humor is not that consistant. That's the biggest fault of the story. The evil elf is also neither funny nor scary most of the time. She is mostly irritating. The Christmas breakfast was an anticlimatic ending, too, and we really could have done without the ""lady mallard"".In fact, that poor duck, as well as having all the birds in the film as villians, made me take off a couple stars. The Santa in the movie was one of the fun parts, but the funniest line involving him was not in the film itself. When the credits run, watch out for scenes not in the story, the funniest one being what Eddie Murphy says to the Santa.",positive
Nick Offerman's English accent is an abomination. Clearly Eddie didn't want to make a Christmas movie somewhere cold. Doesn't work,2.0,"It's an OK holiday film. Far too long. Pretty funny, but not funny enough - and only as amusing as it is because of the cast.But Nick Offerman should be ashamed of himself for that abomination of an English accent. The worst example committed to celluloid since Dick Van Dyke in Mary Poppins. Americans won't care but for me, as soon as his character became more involved in the narrative - I had to bail. Just woeful. There is an abundance of excellent British comedy talent based in Los Angeles. Maybe utilise them rather than letting an A-lister with limited range 'have a go'? Cos he's not gonna land any of the British roles he's obviously fantasising about, and presumably why he lobbied for this role.Also, WHY is it set in Southern California?! My guess is that wasn't the original location in the script because it just doesn't work for a holiday movie. Like, at all. Clearly Murphy wanted to make another Christmas film - but didn't want to leave Los Angeles. So this is what we're dealt. It just doesn't work.Would have been a 5 for me for some decent comedy moments if it weren't for Offerman and the sunshine. Waste of time.Summary: Nick Offerman's English accent is an abomination. Clearly Eddie didn't want to make a Christmas movie somewhere cold. Doesn't work.",positive
Wish it was better,5.0,I wish it was better. The movie has a great look and a great leading cast with Eddie Murphy and Julian Bell. Unfortunately only Julian Bell was funny. I only laughed during her scenes.I think the issue was the story. It wasn't very good and it was boring. I really didn't care what the problem was or what Eddie Murphy was trying to accomplish. The live coverage of Candy Cane lane made no sense and the reporters were terrible actors. The news coverage came out of no where. The movie was a mix of a bunch of bad parts and recycled stories. If it's going to recycle a story it needs to be as good as the original or better. I don't ever want to see this movie again.,positive
CC no eye-catching,6.0,"A beautifully average Christmas movie with heart and compassion, but laced with too incomprehensible plots, too crowded of a cast, supporting cast and mumbo jumbo chickens and cows. Even Eddie Murphy is not himself here, seems lost, at times disinterested and grumpy in his heart, not showing his awesome funny smile and comedic capabilities (though the film screenplay nearly doesn't help with those either). Believe it or not, Jillian Bell (Pepper) had the best acting out there.The visuals are beautiful and at times stunning, but visuals get destroyed when the script and to some levels the acting + the score are not on par. That's not a goofy police procedural where you can walk gray-colored in brightly colored comedy photography and filming. Nevertheless, that's exactly what happened, uncompelling characters as a whole with so so acting (-50%) blended with a (+15%) score in a colorful filming environment (+75%) and the result is around 38% at best.That's what the director Reginald Hudlin needs to take into account in her next comedy project!Screenplay/storyline/plots: 5Development: 7.5Realism: 5.5Entertainment: 5.5Acting: 6Filming/photography/cinematography: 8VFX / CGI: 7.5Music/score/sound: 6Depth: 6Logic: 5Flow: 5.5Comedy/family/fantasy: 5.5Ending: 5.",positive
A slap in the face to Christians,1.0,"I was hoping for some Christmas magic from a family friendly (PG) film with a master comedian - Mr. Eddie Murphy. About 15 -20 minutes into the movie they visit a magic Christmas decorations store. The elf in charge wants to make sure the Eddie Murphy character knows the true meaning of Christmas. He responds with (my paraphrase) Giving, the heart of a child, and loving your neighbor (or something similar.) The elf doesn't respond and Eddie's character says: Or I can go the religious route? The elf responds, ""Jesus Christ, no."" Excuse me - isn't that the reason we have this holiday? I shut if off immediately. What a blatant slap in the face to millions of Christians in America! Hollywood has once again shown their true colors. Skip this one unless you're an atheist or of another religion.",positive
Could have been very good but its just bad. This is not the Christmas movie you are looking for.,3.0,"This has all the concepts to be a great Christmas movie but it seems to suffer from poor editing, bad acting and some terrible casting choices. Some scenes are not needed and some scenes are so stretched out you cant help but think ""Oh get on with it"". These scenes slow the whole movies flow & keep taking you out of the story. So many times in this movie I was actually bored. Some of the acting is the worst I have seen in a long time, worse than some straight to TV movies. In conclusion a decent idea & story ruined by too many boring talking scenes that someone felt needed to be left in the movie. & some awful casting choices. Best avoid this one & enjoy another Christmas movie instead.",negative
Absolute garbage.,1.0,"The only thing Christmas about this was basically nothing. This is more of an anti-christmas movie. So many good actors and their talent was wasted on a worthless script. The characters were not well developed at all and none were relatable. All of Eddie Murphy's talent and charisma were lost in a weak plot with more holes than swiss cheese. It felt like a patch quilt of activities stitched together in an almost random pattern to arrive to the end of the story. What a disappointment. We can all hope this goes straight to the bottom of the video pile and never again sees the light of day. Now go see something better (basically anything, at this point).",positive
This movie is the WORST!,1.0,This movie is so bad that halfway through I just could not watch it any more. It is the equivalent to pouring acid into my eyes like eyedrops. I can not recommend this movie under any circumstances. Watching paint dry is more entertaining than this. The characters in this film are so basic its sad and it has the weirdest plot ever. This movie is a disgrace to christmas and movies everywhere. This movie is just about collecting rings and the little christmas dolls are so weird. I Would not under any circumstances watch this. Stay far away from this film. No matter how board you may be DO NOT WATCH THIS TERRIBLE MOVIE.,negative
What a real let down Xmas movie,3.0,"Who is tracee Lee who plays Eddie Murphys wife? Can't even act, in fact all the characters in this film need to go back to acting school. Trying way too hard to please. I had high expectations but its a real letdown xmas film, maybe because of the there's no Xmas feel to it, I wouldn't say it's boring but I had several conversations with hubby whilst watching this because it had yawn moments. I love Eddie Murphy films but this was a real let down please don't do anymore with tracee Lee. The best parts were watching the Xmas houses light up. Please please can we have simple Xmas movies with simple actors not trying too hard to try and be funny when they're not.",positive
Total Disappointment!,1.0,"Wow, where to begin. Even though I am a long time Eddie Murphy fan, sadly not even he could carry this movie. The story was long, boring & lacking in any character or storyline development to draw the audience in to connect with the characters. The interaction between actors felt forced with no emotional development with an emphasis more on satisfying identity politics than on choosing the best actor for the role. The dialogue felt forced, lazy & was often loud, vulgar & superficial. There was also a point in the movie that was outright bigoted towards Christians demonstrating Hollywood's disdain towards those with religious beliefs. Sadly, the humor was totally absent with not one scene where I found myself laughing out loud. I have no idea what Eddie Murphy was thinking when he took this role. I struggled to make it through to the end finding myself wishing that the movie would just end already. It's as if they just threw this movie together hoping that Eddie Murphy's presence would be enough to win over the audience. Sadly, this is not the case. Hollywood has gotten lazy with total lack of creativity. Don't waste your time on this mess. Better to break out the classics.",positive
